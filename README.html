<h1>Play Midnight - Firefox Addon</h1>

<h2>A Nighttime Theme for Google Play Music</h2>

<p>Play Midnight is a different take on the standard theme that is used on Google Play Music. As much as I love the original look of Play, the brightness can hurt the eyes after a while. After noticing there wasn&rsquo;t a dark alternative Play Midnight came to be.</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>The Firefox Addon for Play Midnight uses CSS generated via SASS for the different color options. These files are all self-contained in the /sass folder and should be commented somewhat to help you understand where each of the settings are.</p>
